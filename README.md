EclipseFrills Plugin
--------------------

This Eclipse plugin was a collection of little bits of functionality provided as plugins.
This project has not been developed in quite a while and will most likely not work in the current Eclipse environment.

If you are interested in taking over or building onto this plug-in please let me know and I can help you get things setup.

The Eclipse projects that made up the parts of this whole plugin have been condensed into a single git repository for simple archiving.
