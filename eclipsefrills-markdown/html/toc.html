		<h1>EclipseFrills Markdown Plug-in</h1>

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		
		Markdown is a simple "markup" language that flows a little easier than HTML when writing documentation or articles. 
		This plug-in provides a set of functionality that makes Markdown a little easier to use and interact with by providing
		an editor, as well as an export wizard which can export the generated HTML.
